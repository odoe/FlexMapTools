h1. FlexMapTools: A collection of components and tools for use with the "ESRI Flex API":http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/flex/index.html.

These are tools I use in my day to day workflow and felt I would share with others.

For more information about the ESRI Flex API, please visit http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/flex/index.html

h3. Disclaimer
Because ESRI has a download page for their Flex API where they ask that you register, I will not be providing the ESRI Flex API swc file.
Please visit the "ESRI Flex API dowload page":http://resources.arcgis.com/content/arcgis-flex-api-how-to-download

I am not employed or affiliated with ESRI beyond being a user of their products.

Enjoy.
